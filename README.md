# Hotaru_Adobe_Illustrator

This is the script repository for the Hotaru Adobe Illustrator scripts.  Currently there are 2 scripts in here, as *.jsx files.

**font_changer_bb.jsx** opens all the *.ai or *.eps files in a folder and replaces the fonts therein with user-specified fonts.  For example, you can be like "Find all Times New Roman Bold and replace it with Courier New Italics!"

**illustrator_text_grabber-replacer.jsx** opens all the *.ai or *.eps files in a folder and extracts the text from each text frame in the files.  It can also put all the extracted text back into the files (in the same text frame it originally came from).  This is useful when doing translation of *.ai files.  You can, for example, extract all the English from the files to *.txt files, then have those *.txt files translated.  When the translation is finished, you can re-import the *.txt files into Illustrator, thus changing the language.
